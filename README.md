# Password Strength Analyzer

This project is a password strength analyzer that I built from scratch as a personal learning project in computer science and cybersecurity.

I worked on this project for about two months. During this time, I gradually added new features while learning web development and basic security concepts. I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript mainly through YouTube tutorials and immediately applied what I learned directly to this website.

All the code in this project was written by me. I started with a blank file and built the entire website step by step, without using templates or website builders.

## Live Demo

## Project Description

The website analyzes how strong a password is based on several factors such as length, character variety, and entropy. It then gives visual feedback and estimates how resistant the password would be to brute-force attacks.

The purpose of this project is educational. It is designed to help users understand what makes a password secure and to help me better understand how cybersecurity concepts work in practice.

No passwords are stored, saved, or sent to any server. All analysis is done on the client side.

## Features

- Real-time password analysis  
- Password strength meter  
- Entropy-based evaluation  
- Password requirement checks  
- Estimated password cracking time  
- Simple and clean user interface  

## Technologies Used

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- JSON  
- Deployed on Vercel  

## What I Learned

While building this project, I learned:
- How modern websites are structured  
- How JavaScript logic interacts with the user interface  
- How password entropy and brute-force attacks are estimated  
- How to debug problems and improve code by testing  
- How to learn independently and apply knowledge immediately  

This project helped me understand whether I want to continue studying computer science and cybersecurity at a deeper level.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to improve this project by adding server-side features, more advanced security checks, and better password recommendations.
